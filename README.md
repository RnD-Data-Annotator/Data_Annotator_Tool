# Data Annotator

## Overview
Data Annotator exists as a solution to three common problems concerning unstructured data annotation for training Machine Learning Models:
### 1. Named-Entity Recognition
Our tool facilitates uploading unstructured text files like articles, reports, book passages, and more. From there, users may create classes (ie NAME, COUNTRY, ) and subsequently classify tokens from the text. Data Annotator makes creating, tracking, and altering classes and classifications a seamless process. 
### 2. Collaboration
The project management system allows project managers to create their personal team of annotators and assign each annotator to a however many files they want for classification.
### 3. Managing Annotated Data
Data Annotator maintains a live preview of each file's annotations as it is being worked on. The addition or removal of classes and entities is tracked and reflected, providing users with a clear impression of how their finished JSON file will look once exported.
